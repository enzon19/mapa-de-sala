## Why?

**This is my first Svelte project shipped to production!** And I don't think the code is good enough...

A friend and I had this cool idea to track where each person sits in class every day. The main goal was to visualize how seating positions change over time — especially by the end of the year. People usually sit near their friends, but friendships evolve: some fade, new ones form, and that often leads to people changing where they sit.

As we collected more data, I realized I could also track attendance — absences and presences — and display that info to help students avoid reaching attendance limits imposed by the school. From there, I added even more features: heatmaps, rankings and position streaks.
